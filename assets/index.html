<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Nova Scotia Genealogy Reports</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prepared by Douglas Goff, 7748 Wellington Rd 22, Guelph, ON N1H 6J2, email goff.doug <i>at </i>gmail.com.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have been doing genealogical research about my family from Nova Scotia, Canada, for forty years. I would be pleased to communicate with any near or far relatives about any of my work. Here you can find several reports I have prepared about various families, which is an interim step to developing a full-blown searchable genealogy website from my Reunion file (which now has 24,000 people). In the meantime, perhaps this will be of help to others and may help me to connect with others who are interested in these families.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My father's family focuses on Halifax and Hants Counties. Surnames  for which I have done the most work include Goff, Holland, Dickey, MacInnes, McDougall, McMullin, Fraser, Dill, McPhee and Burgess. Also I have a Wright family from the Township of Clements, Annapolis County.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My mother's family is all from Colchester County. Surnames for which I have done the most work include Whidden, Newcomb, Tupper, Fisher, Roode, Groves, Sweet, Blois, Fielding, Deyarmond, Baird, Wilson, Hamilton, and Archibald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many of these families have been well documented, others not. As a researcher, I have tried to focus on those families that are not well documented.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Descendancy Reports</b></span><span class="s1">. The following are descendancy reports for various families for whom I have done considerable primary research.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Goff</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/GoffFamilyHalifaxCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/GoffFamilyHalifaxCountyNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">John Goff came from Ireland to Nova Scotia some time before 1796. His son Thomas lived in the Bedford basin area, and then, together with his son William, settled the area of Goffs, near the Halifax airport.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Deyarmond</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/DeyarmondColchesterNovaScotiaDescendancy.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/DeyarmondColchesterNovaScotiaDescendancy.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alexander Deyarmond and Mary Barnhill were amongst the first settlers of Truro. Their son Robert and his wife Ann (Nancy) Wilson were amongst the first settlers of Upper Stewiacke, Colchester County. This report presents the descendants of Alexander and Robert, with a focus on Robert’s son Samuel and his wife Susannah Wilson Baird, from whom I descend.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Tupper</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3"><a href="/TupperFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/TupperFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s5"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Eliakim Tupper removed from New England to the western part of Nova Scotia about the year 1760, and about the year 1773 he removed to Truro. He left<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Truro and removed to Stewiacke about the year 1792. He was married to Elizabeth Newcomb about the time they first came to Nova Scotia.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Dickey</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/DickeyDickieFamilyColchesterNovaScotia2016.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/DickeyDickieFamilyColchesterNovaScotia2016.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">David Dickie was born in Ireland, came to New England in 1716 and settled in New Hampshire. Adam, Robert and David Dickie, sons of David Dickie and Isabel McGlaughlin, were all Grantees of Truro in 1760. They generally took the spelling of Dickey in Truro. David relocated to the Musquodoboit valley. This report presents the early generations of descendants of these three brothers, with a focus on David of Musquodoboit (from whom I descend).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Fraser</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3"><a href="/FraserHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/FraserHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s6"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">James Fraser was a disbanded Revolutionary War soldier who settled in Douglas Township, Hants County, NS in 1783. His son James II left many Fraser descendants in the area, and this report covers their descendancy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Groves</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/GeorgeGrovesRegisterDec2015.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/GeorgeGrovesRegisterDec2015.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">George Groves, a native of London, England, married Elizabeth Ann Sweet, a native of Hants Co., NS, in Boston, and they settled in Onslow, Colchester County, and raised a large family, many of whom moved back to the Boston area.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Hamilton</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/HamiltonFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/HamiltonFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Robert Hamilton was one of Colchester County's early settlers. This report presents his descendants, with a focus especially on the descendants on Hants and Mary (Hamilton) Hamilton, of Upper Stewiacke.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">McDougall</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/McDougallHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/McDougallHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This report presents the descendants of Donald (Daniel) McDougall of Nine Mile River and Kempt Shore, Hants Co., and Antrim/Guysborough Road, Halifax County. He was a disbanded soldier of the 84th Regiment from Scotland who settled in Douglas Township in 1786. This is a distinct family separate from the Donald McDougall or William McDougall families of Maitland or Riverside/Kennetcook areas, and also a separate family from the Alexander McDougall family of Musquodoboit (although there may be a relation to this latter family).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">McMullin</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/McMullin(McMullen)Families-HalifaxCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/McMullin(McMullen)Families-HalifaxCountyNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This report presents the descendants of Archibald McMullen of  Antrim/Guysborough Road, Halifax County, who came to Nova Scotia from Ireland in 1821. I have done a considerable amount of primary research in this family.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Kellough</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3"><a href="/KelloughNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/KelloughNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s6"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There were two Killough/Kellough families in the Gays River (Colchester, Halifax and Hants Cos.) and area - this is a brief overview of these families.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Sweet</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/SweetFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/SweetFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">James Sweet was a son of Benoni Sweet, who was born in North Kingstown, Rhode Island and died in Scotch Village, Hants Co., Nova Scotia, and Lydia Dimock. Benoni was a son of the Benoni Sweet who came to Nova Scotia in 1760 from North Kingstown, Rhode Island  and settled in Cornwallis, Kings Co., NS. Although the descendants of other children of Benoni Sweet (Jr.) have been well researched, notably by Maribelle Smiley and Iola Young, the descendents of James are less well known. James settled in Rawdon but his son Wellington settled in Truro.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Wright</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/WrightFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/WrightFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joseph Wright settled in the Township of Clements, Annapolis County, perhaps as early as 1784.  He had sons James and Joseph, perhaps also William. There were many children and grandchildren of James and Joseph Jr. in the Annapolis and Digby areas, but this is a separate family from the John Wright of Digby family and the John Wright of Granville family.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Milner</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/MilnerFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/MilnerFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jonathan Milner, son of John and Elizabeth (Ringrose) Milner, was one of the Yorkshire settlers to Granville, Annapolis County. Because my interest is in the Wright family (I am a descendant of Ward and Anna (Milner) Wright), and there is considerable overlap in the early records, I have prepared a report that focuses only on the first four generations of descendants of Jonathan and Ann (Oliver) Milner, who resettled from Granville to Clements Township. For anyone looking for their Milner roots, this should be enough to connect you to the birth, marriage, death and census records.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b> </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Ancestry Reports</b></span><span class="s1"><b>.</b> Since the descendancy of the following families is widely available, but the ancestry is perhaps less well known, these reports focus on the ancestry or lineage of some of the well known early settlers to Truro, from whom I descend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Deyarmond</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="/DeyarmondColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.uoguelph.ca/~dgoff/DeyarmondColchesterNovaScotia.pdf<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>

<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Peter Long (1786-1858) and his wife Martha Langley (1788-1835) raised a family of 11 children in Clements Township, Annapolis County, NS. Her parents, John Langley and Beulah Winchester, were both from New England families.

<p class="p10"><span class="s1">I put together an ancestry file focusing on Burgess, Kilcup, Wood and Sanford immigrants from New England to Kings and Hants Counties, which also includes Clarke, Church, Westcott and Hovey surnames, amongst others. Many of these lines go back to early 1600s in New England, including passengers on the Mayflower. The file also includes the Dill surname, although not from New England. Hopefully this will be of interest to anyone in NS with NE roots through these surnames.</span></p>
