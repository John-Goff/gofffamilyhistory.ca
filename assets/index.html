  <h1>Nova Scotia Genealogy Reports</h1>
  <hr>

  <p class="maintext spacetop">
    Prepared by Douglas Goff, 7748 Wellington Rd 22, Guelph, ON N1H 6J2, email goff.doug <i>at</i> gmail.com.
  </p>

  <p class="maintext spacetop">
    I have been doing genealogical research about my family from Nova Scotia, Canada, for more than forty years.  I would be pleased to communicate with any near or far relatives about any of my work. Here you can find several reports I have prepared about various families from my Reunion file (which now has 30,000 people). I hope these will be on interest to and help others with their family research, and may help me to connect with others who are interested in these families.
  </p>

  <p class="maintext spacetop">
    My father's family focuses on Halifax and Hants Counties. Surnames for which I have done the most work include Goff, Holland, Dickey, MacInnes, McDougall, McMullin, Fraser, Dill, McPhee and Burgess. Also I have Wright, Long and Milner families from the Township of Clements, Annapolis County.
  </p>

  <p class="maintext spacetop">
    My mother's family is all from Colchester County. Surnames for which I have done the most work include Whidden, Newcomb, Tupper, Fisher, Roode, Groves, Sweet, Blois, Fielding, Deyarmond, Baird, Wilson, Hamilton, and Archibald.
  </p>

  <p class="maintext spacetop">
    Many of these families have been well documented, others not. As a researcher, I have tried to focus on those families that are not well documented.
  </p>

  <h3 class="spacetop">Descendancy Reports</h3>
  <hr>
  <p class="maintext">
    The following are descendancy reports for various families for whom I have done considerable primary research.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Goff</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/GoffFamilyHalifaxCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/GoffFamilyHalifaxCountyNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    John Goff came from Ireland to Nova Scotia some time before 1796. His son Thomas lived in the Bedford basin area, and then, together with his son William, settled the area of Goffs, near the Halifax airport.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Deyarmond</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/DeyarmondColchesterNovaScotiaDescendancy.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/DeyarmondColchesterNovaScotiaDescendancy.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    Alexander Deyarmond and Mary Barnhill were amongst the first settlers of Truro. Their son Robert and his wife Ann (Nancy) Wilson were amongst the first settlers of Upper Stewiacke, Colchester County. This report presents the descendants of Alexander and Robert, with a focus on Robert's family since I descend from his son Samuel and his wife Susannah Wilson Baird.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Whidden</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/WhiddenFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/WhiddenFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    James Whidden and his four sons came to Truro in 1761, and he became a Grantee of the Township. This report presents the descendancy of this family through six generations.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Tupper</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/TupperFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/TupperFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    Eliakim Tupper removed from New England to the western part of Nova Scotia about the year 1760, and about the year 1773 he removed to Truro. He left Truro and removed to Stewiacke about the year 1792. He was married to Elizabeth Newcomb about the time they first came to Nova Scotia.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Dickey</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/DickeyDickieFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/DickeyDickieFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    David Dickie was born in Ireland, came to New England in 1716 and settled in New Hampshire. Adam, Robert and David Dickey, sons of David Dickie and Isabel McGlaughlin, were all Grantees of Truro in 1760. They generally took the spelling of Dickey in Truro. Adam's sons settled in Lower Stewiacke while David's only son in Nova Scotia relocated to the Musquodoboit valley (from whom I descend). There were two other unrelated Dickey/Dickie families in the Truro, Stewiacke and Musquodoboit areas, and I have also included a brief sketch of their families, so as to separate "who's who".
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Fraser</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/FraserHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/FraserHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    James Fraser was a disbanded Revolutionary War soldier who settled in Douglas Township, Hants County, NS in 1783. His son James II left many Fraser descendants in the area, and this report covers their descendancy.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Dill</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/DillFamilyWindsorNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/DillFamilyWindsorNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    Mungo Dill, married to Rachel Forswell/Frizzell, and his half-brother David Dill, married to Jane Walker, are the ancestors of a large family of Dill’s in the Windsor area and Douglas Township of Hants County, Nova Scotia. This report describes fairly completely their descendants. 
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Kilcup</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/KilcupFamilyWindsorNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/KilcupFamilyWindsorNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    William Kilcup was an American Revolutionary soldier and loyalist, the son of George Kilcup and Margaret Detton from Boston. He joined the Royal American Regiment in Amesbury, Mass., was in Louisburg, Nova Scotia, in 1760-61 and was mustered out after that. He married Hannah Lutches, the daughter of a Dutch immigrant to Nova Scotia and they settled in Windsor, NS, later in Ellershouse, Hants County. Most, if not all, of the Kilcups from Windsor and Hants and Kings Counties are descended from William and Hannah. Many of the third and fourth generations returned to Boston. This report provides as complete a descendancy as I can based on information available. 
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">McPhee</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/McPheeHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/McPheeHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    This report is not intended to be a complete history of the McPhee’s (there are 190 McPhee’s in Hants County in the 1871 census!), rather to supply information freely on the internet that may be useful to younger generations trying to connect their McPhee families back to Hants County. It seems that there were three founding McPhee families in the same area. John McPhee Sr. (1725-1811) and Catherine MacDonald are my 5-great grandparents, through their son John Jr. So this report is mostly focused on them. James McPhee (1758-1842), also of Douglas Township, Hants County, was thought to be a son of John McPhee Sr., but DNA has proved this is not the case. The late Alice Mombourquette has written an extensive genealogy on the family of James McPhee, available through the Genealogical Association of Nova Scotia, but I have not accessed this source. I include a brief sketch of the family of James and Nancy (Benjamin?) McPhee as an Appendix. William “Black Bill” McPhee (ca1760-1844) arrived in Nova Scotia in 1802, possibly a nephew of John Sr., and lived in the Nine Mile River area (part of Douglas Township), where he was granted land in 1807. His wife was Jennet McMillan and they had a family of seven; their children overlap in ages with many of John McPhee Sr.’s grandchildren. I have also included some of the descendants of this William McPhee as an Appendix.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Groves</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/GrovesNovaScotiaRegister.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/GrovesNovaScotiaRegister.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    George Groves, a native of London, England, married Elizabeth Ann Sweet, a native of Hants Co., NS, in Boston, and they settled in Onslow, Colchester County, and raised a large family, many of whom moved back to the Boston area.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Hamilton</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/HamiltonFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/HamiltonFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    Robert Hamilton was one of Colchester County's early settlers. This report presents his descendants, with a focus especially on the descendants on Hants and Mary (Hamilton) Hamilton, of Upper Stewiacke.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Fisher</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/FisherFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/FisherFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    William Fisher, who married Eleanor Archibald, and his nephew Samuel Fisher, who married Mary Tupper, both emigrated from New Hampshire to Truro, William in 1762, Samuel in 1767 with his half-sister Janet (Fisher) Archibald. Their families established some of the original pioneering families in both the Stewiacke and Musquodoboit Valley’s. This report details their descendants.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h5>McDougall</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/McDougallHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/McDougallHantsCountyNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    This report presents the descendants of Donald (Daniel) McDougall of Nine Mile River and Kempt Shore, Hants Co., and Antrim/Guysborough Road, Halifax County. He was a disbanded soldier of the 84th Regiment from Scotland who settled in Douglas Township in 1786. This is a distinct family separate from the Donald McDougall or William McDougall families of Maitland or Riverside/Kennetcook areas, and also a separate family from the Alexander McDougall family of Musquodoboit (although there may be a relation to this latter family).
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">McMullin</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/McMullin(McMullen)Families-HalifaxCountyNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/McMullin(McMullen)Families-HalifaxCountyNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    This report presents the descendants of Archibald McMullen of Antrim/Guysborough Road, Halifax County, who came to Nova Scotia from Ireland in 1821. I have done a considerable amount of primary research in this family.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Kellough</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/KelloughNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/KelloughNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    There were two Killough/Kellough families in the Gays River (Colchester, Halifax and Hants Cos.) and area - this is a brief overview of these families.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Sweet</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/SweetFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/SweetFamilyColchesterNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    James Sweet was a son of Benoni Sweet, who was born in North Kingstown, Rhode Island and died in Scotch Village, Hants Co., Nova Scotia, and Lydia Dimock. Benoni was a son of the Benoni Sweet who came to Nova Scotia in 1760 from North Kingstown, Rhode Island  and settled in Cornwallis, Kings Co., NS. Although the descendants of other children of Benoni Sweet (Jr.) have been well researched, notably by Maribelle Smiley and Iola Young, the descendents of James are less well known. James settled in Rawdon but his son Wellington settled in Truro.
  </p>
  
  <h5 class="spacetop">Wright</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/WrightFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/WrightFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    Joseph Wright settled in the Township of Clements, Annapolis County, perhaps as early as 1784.  He had sons James and Joseph, perhaps also William. There were many children and grandchildren of James and Joseph Jr. in the Annapolis and Digby areas, but this is a separate family from the John Wright of Digby family and the John Wright of Granville family.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Long</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/LongFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/LongFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    Peter Long is recognized as the founder of a large family of descendants from his origins on the Hessian Line, Clementsvale, Annapolis County. His father was a disbanded German soldier from the American Revolution who obtained a land grant on the Hessian Line. Peter married Martha Langley, and I have followed descendants from four sons (Jacob, William Bennett, Ephraim Daniels, and John Henry) and three daughters (Margaret Ann Henshaw, Lydia Jane Trimper and Beulah Elizabeth Wright).
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Milner</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/MilnerFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/MilnerFamilyClementsAnnapolisNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    Jonathan Milner, son of John and Elizabeth (Ringrose) Milner, was one of the Yorkshire settlers to Granville, Annapolis County. Because my interest is in the Wright family (I am a descendant of Ward and Anna (Milner) Wright), and there is considerable overlap in the early records, I have prepared a report that focuses only on the first four generations of descendants of Jonathan and Ann (Oliver) Milner, who resettled from Granville to Clements Township. For anyone looking for their Milner roots, this should be enough to connect you to the birth, marriage, death and census records.
  </p>

  <h3 class="spaceextended">Ancestry Reports</h3>
  <hr>
  <p class="maintext">
    Since the descendancy of the following families is widely available, but the ancestry is perhaps less well known, these reports focus on the ancestry or lineage of some of the well-known early settlers to Truro, from whom I descend.
  </p>

  <h5 class="spacetop">Deyarmond</h5>
  <p class="url">
    <a href="/DeyarmondColchesterNovaScotia.pdf">http://www.gofffamilyhistory.ca/DeyarmondColchesterNovaScotia.pdf</a>
  </p>

    Peter Long (1786-1858) and his wife Martha Langley (1788-1835) raised a family of 11 children in Clements Township, Annapolis County, NS. Her parents, John Langley and Beulah Winchester, were both from New England families. This report presents their ancestry back to New England immigrants, including surnames of Tolman, Parks, Pierce, Leadbetter, Clapp, Davenport, Phipps, Davenport, amongst others.

  </p>
  <p class="maintext">
    I put together an ancestry file focusing on Burgess, Kilcup, Wood and Sanford immigrants from New England to Kings and Hants Counties, which also includes Clarke, Church, Westcott and Hovey surnames, amongst others. Many of these lines go back to early 1600s in New England, including passengers on the Mayflower. The file also includes the Dill surname, although not from New England. Hopefully this will be of interest to anyone in NS with NE roots through these surnames.
